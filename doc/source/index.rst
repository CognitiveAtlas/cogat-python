The Cognitive Atlas is a collaborative knowledge base (an ontology) that characterizes the state of current thought in cognitive science, including concepts, disorders, task paradigms, and associated contrasts and conditions. This Application Programming Interface (API) affords programmatic access to this knowledge.  Currently, all functions are ”GET only,” meaning that you can read but not write to the ontology. View, and contribute to the ontology at `http://cognitiveatlas.org <http://cognitiveatlas.org>`_.
